// the first if statement gets the value of the clicked div's(square) cellIndex attribute (0 to 8).
// the value of the attribute (0 to 8) is stored to the selectedSquareIndex variable. 
// the value stored to the selectedSquare Index variable is not an integer because the value is not being converted to an integer. In JavaScript, when you retrieve values from HTML attributes using methods like getAttribute, the values are returned as strings. This is because HTML attributes are inherently string-based. Adding the "+" before the (selectedSquare.getAttribute("cellIndex")) converts the value to an integer.
