# tic_tac_toe

## Project Overview
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a tic-tac-toe game application. The game ends if a win condition or a draw condition is met. When a win condition is met, the win counter increases by one for the winning player. The first player switches between each game. 

## Project Goals 
- Demonstrate DRY JavaScript and event delegation to handle similar event listeners.
- Separate the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.
- Iterate through DOM elements using for loops.
- Develop and implement a problem solving process to break down and solve a logical challenge step-by-step. 

## Context:
I am in Module 1 at Turing School of Software & Design. This project took 30 hours to complete. 

## Future Features:
- User can select their own emoji token. 
- A draw counter that increments when a draw condition is met. 

## Wins + Challenges:
*Wins*:
- Succesful implementation of game logic.
- Separation of the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM. 

*Challenges*
- Unsuccesful at refactoring code to remove one nested for loop. 
- It was a challange to write functions that are DRY and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
