# tic_tac_toe

## Project Overview
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to build a tic-tac-toe game application during Module 1 at Turing School of Engineering & Design. The game ends if a win condition or a draw condition is met. When a win condition is met, the win counter increases by one for the winning player. The first player switches between each game. 

## Learning Outcomes 
- Demonstrated DRY JavaScript and event delegation to handle similar event listeners.
- Separated the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.
- Iterated through DOM elements using for loops.
- Developed and implemented a problem solving process to break down and solve a logical challenge step-by-step. 

## Future Features:
- User can select their own emoji token. 
- A draw counter that increments when a draw condition is met. 

## Wins + Challenges:
*Wins*:
- Succesful implementation of game logic.
- Separation of the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM. 

*Challenges*
- Struggled to eliminate a nested for loop, despire efforts to refactor the code structure.
